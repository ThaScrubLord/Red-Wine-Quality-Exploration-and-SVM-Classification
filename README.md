# Red-Wine-Quality-Exploration-and-SVM-Classification
I Perform Exploratory Analysis and SVM on Red Wine Dataset


As an individual who has just recently turned 21 I have realized how clueless I am about alcohol. I don't know anything about most alcohols and despite being Italian I know barely anything about red wine. So to expand my knowledge on the subject, what better way to expand my alcoholic palette than to perform an explorative data analysis on a Red Wine Quality data set. The dataset covers various acidity, sugars, chlorides, sulfurdioxide, density, pH, sulphates, alcohol, and finally a quality score.

I hope to explore:
-How are quality wines different than non quality wines?

-How do different chemical paremeters vary across different wines?

-Are we able to predict the quality of red wine using SVM classification? This data frame offers so many questions that could potentially be answered. The long list of parameters that are included provide lots of valuable and important information for analysis. How do acidic wines compare to non acidic wines in terms of quality? There is so much potential.

-In this project I hope to uncover important parameters in defining a quality wine.
