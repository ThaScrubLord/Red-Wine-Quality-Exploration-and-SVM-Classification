# Red-Wine-Quality-Exploration-and-SVM-Classification
I Perform Exploratory Analysis and SVM on Red Wine Dataset using: <strong> Jupyter Notebooks, Python, matplotlib, and sklearn </strong>

In June 2019, I visited Sezze, Italy, the birthplace of my great-grandfather.  Relatives on my grandfatherâ€™s side of the family, met and welcomed my family and immersed us in the culture of their country...my heritage.  

With exposure to Italian red wines, I decided to expand my knowledge on this subject  and have chosen to perform an explorative data analysis on a Red Wine Quality data set. The data set includes acidity, sugars, chlorides, sulfur dioxide, density, pH, sulphates, alcohol and quality scores.

In this project I hope to uncover parameters of quality wines and answer questions such as:
-How are quality wines different from non quality wines?
-How do different chemical parameters vary across different wines?
-Are we able to predict the quality of red wine using SVM classification?
-How do acidic wines compare to non acidic wines in terms of quality? 

This data exploration has a business application that has the potential to benefit the wine industry in areas of the cultivation and production of quality wines.
